                    <p>There was once a young fellow who enlisted as a soldier, conducted himself bravely, and was always the foremost when it rained bullets. So long as the war lasted, all went well, but when
                    peace was made, he received his dismissal, and the captain said he might go where he liked. His parents were dead, and he had no longer a home, so he went to his brothers and begged them to take him in, and keep him until
                    war broke out again. The brothers, however, were hard-hearted and said, "What can we do with you? You are of no use to us, go and make a living for yourself." The soldier had nothing left but his gun, so he took that on his shoulder, 
                    and went forth into the world.</p>

                    <p>He came to a wide heath, on which nothing was to be seen but a circle of trees, under these he sat sorrowfully down,
                    and began to think over his fate. I have no money, thought he, I have learnt no trade but that of fighting,
                     and now that they have made peace they don't want me any longer, so I see before hand that I shall have to starve. 
                     All at once he heard a rustling and when he looked round, a strange man stood before him, who wore a green coat
                     and looked right stately, but had a hideous cloven foot. "I know already what you are in need of," said the man,
                     "gold and possessions shall you have, as much as you can make away with, do what you will, but first I must know if you 
                    are fearless, that I may not bestow my money in vain." "A soldier and fear - how can those two things go together?" he 
                    answered, "You can put me to the proof." "Very well, then," answered the man, "look behind you." The soldier turned round, 
                    and saw a large bear, which came growling towards him. "Oho," cried the soldier, "I will tickle your nose for you, so that 
                    you shall soon lose your fancy for growling," and he aimed at the bear and shot it through the muzzle, it fell down and never 
                    stirred again. "I see quite well," said the stranger, "that you are not wanting in courage, but there is still another 
                    condition which you will have to fulfil." "If it does not endanger my salvation," replied the soldier, who knew very 
                    well who was standing by him. "If it does, I'll have nothing to do with it." "You will look to that for yourself," answered 
                    greencoat, "you shall for the next seven years neither wash yourself, nor comb your beard, nor your hair, nor cut your nails, 
                    nor once say the Lord's prayer. I will give you a coat and a cloak, which during this time you must wear. If you 
                    die during these seven years, you are mine, if you remain alive, you are free, and rich to boot, for all the rest
                     of your life." The soldier thought of the great extremity in which he now found himself, and as he so often had 
                     gone to meet death, he resolved to risk it now also, and agreed to the terms. The devil took off his green coat, and
                      gave it to the soldier, and said, "If you have this coat on your back and put your hand into the pocket, you will always
                       find it full of money." Then he pulled the skin off the bear and said, "This shall be your cloak, and your bed also, for
                        thereon shall you sleep, and and in no other bed shall you lie, and because of this apparel shall you be called Bearskin."
                         Whereupon the devil vanished. </p>
