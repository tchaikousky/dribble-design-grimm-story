                    <p>As Bearskin was sitting alone in the evening, and wishing from the bottom of his heart that the seven years
                     were over, he heard a loud lamenting in a neighboring room. He had a compassionate heart, so he opened the door, 
                     and saw an old man weeping bitterly, and wringing his hands. Bearskin went nearer, but the man sprang to his feet 
                     and tried to escape from him. At last when the man perceived that Bearskin's voice was human he let himself be prevailed 
                     upon, and by kind words bearskin succeeded so far that the old man revealed the cause of his grief. His property had 
                     dwindled away by degrees, he and his daughters would have to starve, and he was so poor that he could not pay the innkeeper, 
                     and was to be put in prison. "If that is your only trouble," said Bearskin, "I have plenty of money." He caused 
                     the innkeeper to be brought thither, paid him and even put a purse full of gold into the poor old man's pocket. </p>

                    <p>When the old man saw himself set free from all his troubles he did not know how to show his gratitude.
                         "Come with me," said he to Bearskin, "my daughters are all miracles of beauty, choose one of them for yourself
                          as a wife. When she hears what you have done for me, she will not refuse you. You do in truth look a little 
                          strange, but she will soon put you to rights again." This pleased Bearskin well, and he went. When the eldest
                         saw him she was so terribly alarmed at his face that she screamed and ran away. The second stood still and looked
                         at him from head to foot, but then she said, "How can I accept a husband who no longer has a human form? The shaven
                         bear that once was here and passed itself off for a man pleased me far better, for at any rate it wore a
                         hussar's dress and white gloves. If he were only ugly, I might get used to that." The youngest, however, said,
                         "Dear father, that must be a good man to have helped you out of your trouble, so if you have promised him a bride
                          for doing it, your promise must be kept." It was a pity that Bearskin's face was covered with dirt and with hair,
                        for if not they might have seen how delighted he was when he heard these words. He took a ring from his finger, 
                        broke it in two, and gave her one half, the other he kept for himself. Then he wrote his name on her half, and hers on his,
                     and begged her to keep her piece carefully. Then he took his leave and said, "I must still wander about for three years,
                     and if I do not return then, you are free, for I shall be dead. But pray to God to preserve my life." </p>
