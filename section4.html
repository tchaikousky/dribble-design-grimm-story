                    <p>The poor betrothed bride dressed herself entirely in black, and when she thought of her future 
                        bridegroom, tears came into her eyes. Nothing but contempt and mockery fell to her lot from 
                        her sisters. "Take care," said the eldest, "if you give him your hand, he will strike his claws 
                        into it." "Beware," said the second. "Bears like sweet things, and if he takes a fancy to you, 
                        he will eat you up." "You must always do as he likes," began the elder again, or else he will 
                        growl." And the second continued, "But the wedding will be a merry one, for bears dance well." 
                        The bride was silent, and did not let them vex her. Bearskin, however, traveled about the world 
                        from one place to another, did good where he was able, and gave generously to the poor that 
                        they might pray for him.</p>

                    <p>At length, as the last day of the seven years dawned, he went once more out on to the heath, 
                        and seated himself beneath the circle of trees. It was not long before the wind whistled, and 
                        the devil stood before him and looked angrily at him, then he threw bearskin his coat, and 
                        asked for his own green one back. "We have not got so far as that yet," answered Bearskin, 
                        "you must first make me clean." Whether the devil liked it or not, he was forced to fetch 
                        water, and wash Bearskin, comb his hair, and cut his nails. After this, he looked like a 
                        brave soldier, and was much handsomer than he had ever been before.</p>

                    <p> When the devil had gone away, Bearskin was quite lighthearted. He went into the town, put on a 
                        magnificent velvet coat, seated himself in a carriage drawn by four white horses, and drove to his bride's house. 
                        No one recognized him. The father took him for a distinguished general, and led him into the room where his 
                        daughters were sitting. He was forced to place himself between the two eldest, who helped him to wine, gave 
                        him the best pieces of meat, and thought that in all the world they had never seen a handsomer man. The bride, 
                        however, sat opposite to him in her black dress, and never raised her eyes, nor spoke a word. When at length 
                        he asked the father if he would give him one of his daughters to wife, the two eldest jumped up, ran into their 
                        bedrooms to put on splendid dresses, for each of them fancied she was the chosen one.</p>

                    <p>The stranger, as soon as he was alone with his bride, brought out his half of the ring, and threw 
                        it in a glass of wine which he handed across the table to her. She took the wine, but when she had drunk it, 
                        and found the half ring lying at the bottom, her heart began to beat. She got the other half, which 
                        she wore on a ribbon round her neck, joined them, and saw that the two pieces fitted exactly together. Then said he, 
                        "I am your betrothed bridegroom, whom you saw as Bearskin, but through God's grace I have again received my human form, 
                        and have once more become clean." He went up to her, embraced her, and gave her a kiss. In the meantime the two 
                        sisters came back in full dress, and when they saw that the handsome man had fallen to the share of the youngest, 
                        and heard that he was Bearskin, they ran out full of anger and rage. One of them drowned herself in the well, the other 
                        hanged herself on a tree. In the evening, some one knocked at the door, and when the bridegroom opened it, it was the 
                        devil in his green coat, who said, "You see, I have now got two souls in the place of your one."  </p>
