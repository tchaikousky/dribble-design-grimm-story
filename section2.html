                    <p>The soldier put the coat on, felt at once in the pocket, and found that the thing was really true. Then he put on the bearskin and went forth into the world,
                         and enjoyed himself, refraining from nothing that did him good and his money harm.</p>
                    <p>During the first year his appearance was passable, but during the second he began to look
                         like a monster. His hair covered nearly the whole of his face, his beard was like a piece of coarse felt, his fingers had claws
                         , and his face was so covered with dirt that if cress had been sown on it, it would have come up. Whosoever saw him, ran away, but as he everywhere gave the poor
                          money to pray that he might not die during the seven years, and as he paid well for everything he still always found shelter.</p>

                    <p>In the fourth year, he entered an inn where the landlord would not receive him, and would not
                         even let him have a place in the stable, because he was afraid the horses would be scared. But as Bearskin thrust
                          his hand into his pocket and pulled out a handful of ducats, the host let himself be persuaded and gave him
                           a room in an outhouse. Bearskin, however, was obliged to promise not to let himself be seen, lest the inn should get a bad name. </p>
